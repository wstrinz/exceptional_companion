Some scripts and hacks to help with [Fallen London][1]

( idiomatic FL description coming eventually :wink: )

[1]: https://fallenlondon.storynexus.com

## Installation
Add `fl_tampermonkey.js` as a TamperMonkey script.

## Features
- Click on qualities to choose optimal items
- Tracks events / branches so you can know what you've explored
  - Works locally out of the box, can be shared / persisted over couchdb
- `Ctrl + Shift + G` while hovering over a storylet title to grind the storylet
- `Ctrl + Shift + A` to automatically play opportunity cards based on "plan" markings
- Full of hacks and weird JS code
- Probably violates FL's TOS

## Obvious Warning
This is seriously lazily hacked together code. I am not responsible for any damage to
your FL account, browser, or the fabric of spacetime.
